Ahoy newly minted hacker!

This guide will walk you through the basics of playing Superteam Security CTF's.

These challenges are designed for you to pick up skills to become a web3 auditor!

## Heist Mission - steal a billion tokens

![](https://i.imgur.com/28etXO2.jpg)

To get you started on your journey to become a badass security auditor, we have prepared a vulnerable contract that contains a billion tokens.

If you are able to exploit the contract, a billy will be transferred to your account!

## Vulnerable contract

Please download the [source code of the vulnerable contract](https://pub-cf83a7a9f877444b8a25c86e506ef797.r2.dev/0x101.zip) and load it up on your favourite text editor.

Psst...the vulnerability lies in this code section of the contract!

As the contract is deployed on-chain, you will be sending the attack payload through a client.

## Client side code

The source code, that you had previously downloaded in the previous step, also contains a sample for the client.

You use a client to send the attack payload to the contract ü™Ñ

```typescript
import * as anchor from "@project-serum/anchor";
import { Program } from "@project-serum/anchor";
import { HelloSupersec } from "../target/types/hello_supersec";
import { getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount } from "@solana/spl-token";
import NodeWallet from "@project-serum/anchor/dist/cjs/nodewallet";

describe("test-attack", () => {
  // Configure the client to use Solana devnet cluster.
  const provider = anchor.AnchorProvider.env();
  anchor.setProvider(provider);

  const program = anchor.workspace.HelloSupersec as Program<HelloSupersec>;

  it("construct_attack_payload", async () => {
    // üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è INPUT ATTACK PAYLOAD //
    const magicString = new anchor.BN(0);

    const tx = await program.methods.challenge(magicString);
    const autoInferKey = await tx.pubkeys();
    const challKey = autoInferKey.challAccount;

    let ata = await getOrCreateAssociatedTokenAccount(
      provider.connection,
      (provider.wallet as NodeWallet).payer,
      autoInferKey.rewardMint,
      provider.publicKey
    );

    tx.accounts({
      receiver: ata.address,
    });
    const txHash = await tx.rpc({ skipPreflight: true });

    console.log("Your transaction signature", txHash);

    const confirmTx = await provider.connection.getSignatureStatus(txHash);
    if (confirmTx.value?.confirmationStatus === "confirmed") {
      try {
        const tx = await program.account.challAccount.fetch(challKey);
        if (tx.pawned === true) {
          console.log(
            "Congratulations, you successfully exploited the contract üéâ"
          );
        } else {
          console.log("Sorry, your attack failed. Please grind more üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è");
        }
      } catch (e) {
        console.log(e);
      }
    }
  });
});
```

## How to finally steal a billy?

As a web3 auditor, the majority of work lies in [fuzzing](https://owasp.org/www-community/Fuzzing) the contract and then crafting the attack payload that finally exploits it.

We recommend:

- Downloading and opening [source code of the vulnerable contract](https://pub-cf83a7a9f877444b8a25c86e506ef797.r2.dev/0x101.zip)
- Fuzzing the contract with different payloads through the client. (Hint: you would need a hexadecimal calculator)

If you are able to trigger the contract with the right payload you will get access to the 1 billion tokens stored inside it!

## Need help?

We would be more than happy to help you with any questions.
